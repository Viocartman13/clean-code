<h1>Clean Code</h1>
<h2>First Chapter: Clean Code</h2>

Writing bad code slows production in time. If teams are moving fast at first, if the code isn't clean and clear it will make further development very hard as every method or functionality added requires the understanding of 
a very tangled and mixed up code that could result in adding complexity even bigger to understanding such code and working with such code.
Also adding more developers to a project like this only slows even further production as they also need to understand a very tangled up code.


It is the developers responsability to keep a code clean and organized. Most managers want the truth even if they don't act like it. It's their job to defend the schedule and planning and other similar 
stuff but it's your job as a developer to defend the code.

The only way to go fast and meet deadlines is to keep the code clean, by making a mess things won't get faster so take the time to go fast.

What is Clean Code according to specialists: 

- Clean code does one thing well (Bjarne Stroustrop)
- Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well written prose. (Grady Booch)
- Clean code can be read and enhanced by a developer other than the author. It has meaningful names. (Dave Thomas)
- Clean code looks like it was written by someone who cares about the code. There is nothing obvious that you could do to make it better. (Michael Feathers)
- Reduced duplications, high expresiveness and early building of simple abstraction.That's what makes clean code for me. (Ron Jeffries)
- You know you are working on clean code when each routine you read turns out to be pretty much what you expected. (Ward Cunningham)


We are authors of the code so the next time you write a line of code, remember that and the fact that you are writing for readers who will judge your effort.

The Boy Scout Rule: leave the code a little better than you found it.
It doesn't have to be something big: change one variable name for the better, break up one function that's a little too large, eliminate one small bit of duplication, clean up one composite if statement
